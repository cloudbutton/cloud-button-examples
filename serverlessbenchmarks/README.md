# SeBS: Serverless Benchmark Suite

**FaaS benchmarking suite for serverless functions with automatic build, deployment, and measurements.**

SeBS is a diverse suite of FaaS benchmarks that allows automatic performance analysis of commercial and open-source serverless platforms. We provide a suite of benchmark applications and use them to test and evaluate different components of FaaS systems.

To execute these benchmarks, run the `function.py` file for each corresponding benchmark. This will initiate the benchmark using your Lithops backend.
